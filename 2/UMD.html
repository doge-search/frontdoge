The University of Maryland, College Park (often referred to as The University of Maryland, Maryland, UM, UMD, UMCP, or College Park) is a public research university located in the city of College Park in Prince George's County, Maryland, approximately 4 miles (6.4 km) from the northeast border of Washington, D.C. Founded in 1856, the university is the flagship institution of the University System of Maryland. With a fall 2010 enrollment of more than 37,000 students, over 100 undergraduate majors, and 120 graduate programs, Maryland is the largest university in the state and the largest in the Washington Metropolitan Area. It is a member of the Association of American Universities and competes in athletics as a member of the Big Ten Conference.</br>
The University of Maryland's proximity to the nation's capital has resulted in research partnerships with the Federal government. Members of the faculty receive research funding and institutional support from agencies such as the National Institutes of Health, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and the Department of Homeland Security.[citation needed]</br>
The operating budget of the University of Maryland during the 2009 fiscal year was projected to be approximately US$1.531 billion. For the same fiscal year, the University of Maryland received a total of $518 million in research funding, surpassing its 2008 mark by $118 million. As of May 11, 2012, the university's "Great Expectations" campaign had exceeded $950 million in private donations.

question:马利兰大学 (University of Maryland, College Park，英文简称 UM、UMD、UMCP 或 Maryland) 中文简称马大，是一所在美国排名前列，并在全世界范围内拥有很高知名度的公立研究性大学。大学创建于1856年，位于美国东北部马利兰州大学公园市，共有超过36000名学生就读，是马利兰大学系统的首要成员，同时也是马利兰州以及华盛顿都会区最大的大学，也被认为是公立常春藤院校之一。马大首位华裔校长陆道逵（Wallace D. Loh）于 2010 年 11 月 1 日正式上任。</br>
answer_num:16</br>
answers:</br>
unknown anthor</br>
接楼上对研究生院的讨论。</br>
就整体学术水平而言，马大属于公立大学里的二流。如果说像UCB, UCLA, UIUC这样属于公立大学的一流，那么UMD的整体学术水平跟这些学校比还是差了一个档次，算的上是二流，跟很多其他公立大学处于一个档次(比如Big Ten的一些学校，当然马大现在也是Big Ten了:))。</br>
好在美国大学之间的不均衡不像国内那么严重，这些二流公立虽然整体不如那几个一流公立巨无霸，但每个学校也各有所长，某些专业也是牛人辈出，马大也是这样。马大理科中实力很强的是物理，天文和气象，数学，地质，地理（尤其以地理信息系统）也不错，较冷门的农学和食品科学也还可以，比较弱的是生物和化学。工科中实力最强的是CS, EE和AE，另外ME和 Civil Engineering 也不错，ChemE和MSE实力较弱。文科和商科我不太了解，据说犯罪学全美第一（话说这种冷门学科还有必要排名么？）。马大一些学科实力强跟附近的政府部门有很大关系，比如理科院系多跟NIH, NIST, FDA, USDA等政府研究机构有合作，文科一些院系则和一些政府部门和智库联系比较紧密。</br>
院系实力的强弱跟个人学术造诣不是百分之百的关联，即便实力弱的系也有水平很高的牛人，跟着他们混照样水平能提高不少，但院系的实力直接决定了学生的整体质量和学术氛围。本屌混迹于化学系，但也去隔壁的物理系上了点基础课，能够明显感受到课堂上学生提问和课堂下学生讨论的质量的差别。而化学系和物理系seminar的数量和质量也相差不小，化学系由于近年来经费短缺，一年中都很难请到几位高质量的演讲者，很多时候只能请附近学校或者自己学校的人来讲。物理系的seminar演讲者水平普遍要高，至少Physics Colloquium的演讲者大多数时候水平很高，底下各方向的小型seminar也很多。</br>
避开学术，谈谈生活。马大这个地方生活上的确是让人爱恨交加。先说恨吧，我最最不满的就是学校的治安，因为学校在黑人区。这里所说的黑人区不是指像费城底特律那样的每晚枪战的黑人区，主要是指学校周边都是黑人人口占多数的社区，如果晚上比较晚的时候在校区外围街道独行，被打劫的可能性比较大，因此在学校的时候基本每月都会收到Crime Alert的邮件，通报何时何地某人被打劫，犯罪嫌疑人身材特征，人种一般都是black……不过如果上下学都开车或者坐校车的话被打劫概率基本为零。</br>
关于在这里生活的好处，可以列很多，每个人感受都不一样。其实校园大硬件设施好这些都不算什么啦，美国大多数公立学校基本都这样。各种资源什么也挺丰富的，你对NCAA橄榄球和篮球感兴趣的话可以拿免费学生票去看，想多看演出提升逼格学校的Performing Arts Center也提供免费学生票，不过对于我们这些苦逼的PhD来讲是没有那么多时间去享受生活的。对于很多美国小本来说选择UMD的原因是因为学费低，六年前的时候我记得马大本科生一年的in state tuition还不到一万刀，这在美国公立大学中是非常罕见的，现在虽然涨了一些，但在所有公立大学中还是偏低的。</br>
其他在这个学校生活的好处也基本可以归结为生活在Washington DC Metropolitan Area的好处。这个区域的好处就是经济发达，人种和文化比较多元化，居民整体素质还不错（黑人区和老墨聚居区除外），基础设施发达，四季分明，物价和房价跟纽约湾区比起来还算便宜一点，按照某个美国人的说法大概是"The DC area looks like a suburban area but with urban spirit"。马大本身到DC市中心坐地铁也就半个多小时，所以如果你愿意享受DC的各种文化生活（博物馆，剧院，美食，春季的樱花，独立日的烟花等等）的话，其实还是非常方便的，这比很多处在中西部大农村的学校要好不少。假如你有车又有闲的话，就可以很方便游遍附近马里兰和弗吉尼亚的各处名胜，户外登山，出海钓鱼，可以玩的很多，不一而足。</br>
有两个同学回国后跟我抱怨说，马大在国内人看来就一屌丝学校，别人听都没听说过。屌丝就屌丝吧，可能在大多数国人看来，除了那几所一流公立，其他的公立都是屌丝学校，但在屌丝学校读书不代表你心态上就是屌丝……</br>
</br>
unknown anthor</br>
学术风气不错，同学水平高低不一，大多数学生家境背景一般。学术上差得相当差，大神也不少，主要集中在CS系，个别数学系，EE。</br>
然后妹子质量不好是真的，男多女少是真的。还有就是不要加入马大的CSSA，有毒。</br>

Why is getting into University of Maryland, College Park for masters in computer science difficult?</br>
I have been looking into the admission status of 2013 applicants for University of Maryland,College Park. Unfortunately, none got an admit. Is there anyone on Quora who got an admit? Please share your experience.</br>
Answer:</br>
I helped out with UMD admissions for several years while I was faculty there.</br>
</br>
UMD has fewer MS students than PhD students (unlike other universities, it doesn't treat the MS as a cash cow and push lots of students through it), thus it has very high standards for MS students; it's looking for excellent students who can one day become research collaborators (either in local industry/government or in the PhD program).  MS students are scrutinized as closely as PhD applicants, which as far as I can tell is fairly rare.</br>
Answer:</br>
CS at UMD College Park is a research oriented department.</br>
They started masters program in 2006 with a thinking that if students are not sure about PhD, they can come as masters student and then get converted later. So even a masters application is evaluated like a PhD application. Candidates who are exceptionally good in academics with some prior research done is more likely. Also, I think one of the important factors here is that for each admit a faculty match is needed...someone who sees the applicant as future student. If one applies for MS with no interest in research it is very unlikely that any faculty will vote for that candidate.</br>
<div class="anchor-list"><a name="4_2" class="lemma-anchor para-title"></a></div><div class="para-title level-3"><h3 class="title-text"></br>Question:</br></h3></div>
Should I take an unfunded MS offer in a top CS school like CMU or Stanford or a fully funded direct PhD offer at a slightly lower ranked program like at UCSD or UMD College Park?</br>
Considering the fact that most MS students at CMU or Stanford get funded from the second semester, and some students get funding from the first semester itself, is it worth it to go to places like CMU or Stanford with the risk of being unfunded for 1 or 2 semesters? Or is it better to take a fully funded direct PhD offer from schools ranked around 13-14 in CS (according to US news grad school programs in CS)? How much will be the difference? This is especially relevant for international students, for whom, even the fees for a single semester might be completely out of reach. Also consider the fact that the grad student might eventually do a PhD even if he does go for an MS, and does not take a job immediately to repay the loan.</br>
Answer:</br>
This question is highly subjective to the following scenarios.</br>
</br>
1. If you want to end up in a software job, you can even consider doing courses like MIS where getting an admit in CMU or Stanford is relatively easy.</br>
</br>
2. If you want to do good research, its the research group that matters rather than university name. For example supercomputing research is best in UIUC rather than stanford which barely has professors working on supercomputers. This might get u a good R&D position in a top notch firm.</br>
</br>
3.If you want to take up an academic position after your PhD, there is a good trade of between the ranking of universities and research. Universities like Penn state, UMich and Georgia tech have a significantly strong computer architecture /VLSI department but choosing stanford over them might be really fruitful while taking up an academic position.</br>
</br>
4. Funding - Funding reduced 70% of your burden. Try to go for the funded admit as much as possible.</br>
Answer:</br>
The construction of metrics always makes interesting reading, I went and skimmed the method underlying the Times Higher Education ranking, it's here:</br>
http://www.timeshighereducation....</br>
</br>
From a speed-reading, it seems that this meter is primarily weighted by research volume and impact, with a dash of learning environment that integrates ratios of staff-to-students and such. It probably makes a very useful number to order institutions by their aggregated academic prestige across the board, but it is maybe not such a useful number to estimate what 2 semesters of money struggles will buy for an individual. I'd bet that you could either surf through a high-ranking institution on a cloud of distilled genius, or drop out of one after six weeks of destitution, and neither of those stories make the slightest dent in the statistic, because that's not what it is measuring.</br>
</br>
I don't believe that a difference of 14 unit institution-quality-ranks is likely to account for the biggest factor in your experience, unless what you want is precisely to optimize your number of institution-quality-ranks. The US news one seems to be synthesized from a survey of questionnaires sent to dept. heads and directors of graduate studies: http://www.usnews.com/education/..., the difference of 14 ranks in comp. sci. looks like a difference of a 1-in-5 score from their assessments, as far as I can find. So I guess 1 in 5 or so department heads has a lower opinion of one of your alternatives than of the other, if you think that's worth any risk is kind of up to you.</br>
</br>
You don't state what your goal is in the end, so it's hard to say what's better. If your goal is to become good at what you do, though, it depends a little bit on where you go, but a lot more on the talent and attitude that you bring with you. I think funding is a safer bet than ranking, unless you're in a context where the institution name on a diploma is the main reason why you want it.</br>
Answer:</br>
If you can afford 1 semester of Stanford/CMU, take it. </br>
</br>
There is no question in my mind that the difference between a University ranked in the top 5, vs a University ranked around 15 is significant.</br>
</br>
Let me be clear: in terms of just "education" I don't know if the top ranked universities significantly better than those ranked lower. If quality of education was the only factor, I would say go for the funded offer.</br>
</br>
However, in the long-term there are other factors at work. Consider the brand name. Let me take the example of India: here the names Stanford, MIT, Carnegie Mellon, etc are well known. As for the rest nobody has a clue. As far as they're concerned, there is no difference between UCSD and SUNY Buffalo and NJIT and UW Whitewater - they're all the same except for the top 5. My guess would be that the situation is the same in large parts of the world.</br>
</br>
Does it matter? Yes - under some circumstances. You get a better first impression than those who haven't been to Stanford. If you're doing a small early stage startup, "founded by Stanford Alumni" carries a significant amount of weight with enterprise customers and VCs. Of course, this will only get you the first meeting. After that substance matters - but don't underestimate the importance of the first meeting. When you're applying for a job, the interviewer will come into the interview with a favorable impression, because she saw Stanford on your resume. </br>
</br>
Another difference is the network. I don't have any proof to backup this claim, and I might be wrong, but my gut instinct is that there are likely to be more alumni from your collegein important positions around the world if you graduate from a top 5 college, than there would be from a lower ranked college. And those people will look favorably upon you, even if they happen have graduated 5 or 10 or 15 years before you. The tribe psychology effect will work in your favor.</br>
</br>
But if the fee for 1 semester is out of reach, don't be disappointed. Go ahead and do your PhD in UCSD/UMD. All is not lost. Maybe you will have to work a little harder to be noticed than the Stanford grad, but so what?</br>
Answer:</br>
I want to add a slightly different view to this discussion. The most up voted post seems to take the chase ranking path but I want to completely veer you away from this path.</br>
</br>
Here's the more important question:</br>
What do you want to do with the graduate degree? If you're looking for a specialised software job that doesn't involve significant research, take the ms at Stanford. Being in the bay area and given Stanford's student culture, this will help you in the long run.</br>
</br>
If you wish to work as an academic or a researcher in the industry, look at the research groups you're interested in. Umd and UCSD have brilliant research groups too! That is way more important than the departments ranking. Find a group whose work you find interesting. Also remember that a group that has people with a great reputation (you'll find people of the same calibre at both places), will give you a bigger advantage in the job hunt than the departments reputation as you will mostly interact with very few people apart from these people. And departments and universities can't help influence your recruiters unlike how a reputed mentor can.</br>
</br>
In the event you like both places the same, go with the money. The differences between top 5 and top 15 isn't so much that its worth getting into debt for it.</br>
Answer:</br>
It depends on what you want to do after graduation.</br>
</br>
If you want a software engineering job, then #14 or #1 makes no difference: if you are good, you will be able to get interviews at companies like Google or Facebook. Once you get the interview, the interview performance is the most important factor in determining whether you get an offer.</br>
</br>
If you want to go to grad school after MS, then make sure you choose a school where you can work on research projects with a professor who is reasonably well-known in the field. Though the top universities are still better than the lower ranked ones in this regard, the difference may not be enough to offset the heavy debt.</br>
</br>
If you are choosing a school to do PhD in, I would say the research group and professors matter more than the rank per se, but it is true that the top 5 universities are stellar in most research areas. From my interactions with the students from those groups, everything from the morale, the peer group to the attitude towards research is different. I would highly recommend going to the highest ranked school which does good research in your area.</br>
Answer:</br>
For graduate school, rankings make essentially no difference. Your experience in graduate school, your ability to do good work, to learn to be a good researcher, and to get a position after you graduate is 90% down to who your advisor is, how good a researcher he/she is, how well known he/she is in the field, and how good a mentor he/she is.</br>
</br>
Furthermore, depending on who you are, being a bigger fish in a slightly smaller pond can be a very good thing for a graduate student. It gives you more freedom. You can be a more important part of your research advisor's program,  you may be able to have a more meaningful intellectual relationship, and you can gain more leadership experience. You can also have time to fail. This happened to me. I went to grad school at Maryland, in a field in which I was severely deficient because it was different from the field in which I got my BS. It took me about a year to catch up. That year was really tough, but because my department was small and close-knit, they could tell I had potential, and they gave me time. At MIT, I think I would have flunked out by the second semester. As it is, I earned a PhD with a GPA of 3.9 and am now running a successful research program.</br>
</br>
If I were choosing between graduate schools, my metrics would be something like this:</br>
</br>
1) Is my potential advisor a well respected researcher doing work I am personally interested in?</br>
</br>
2) Is my potential advisor not completely insane? (Note that this is a real concern. Academia attracts more than its fair share of difficult personalities, and having one of those as your advisor is the kiss of death no matter how good your school is. Insider tip: go tour your potential advisor's lab, and take his/her grad students out for a drink after wards *without the advisor knowing*. Ask them for the straight scoop. If they tell you to stay away, do.)</br>
</br>
3) Am I being offered financial aid? Preferably a research assistantship, but a teaching assistantship also works. This aid should cover your tuition completely and give you a (very) modest stipend.</br>
</br>
4) Are there other researchers in my department who are also doing good research, who I can take classes from and collaborate with?</br>
</br>
Note that nowhere would I consider the "quality" of the school. A great advisor at Podunk State U. will give you just as good a graduate education as a poor advisor at Cambridge.</br>

I would like to come in with an important fact the Maryland might rank 10 lower than Stanford but its CS department may not be representative of that. I for a fact know that Computer vision and and complex systems at Maryland is unparalleled in the US. UMD CS, ECE, IREAP and Applied Physics are amongst the top programs around. </br>
</br>
Stanford would lead to better opportunities after graduation since hiring in the US is slightly more regional as compared to where I am from. Even if that was not the case, I would say that there would be better opportunities just lying around for you to choose from at Stanford. The thing is if you want to just complete the course and get a job, it is good to pay Stanford, Yale, Harvard etc. as you could repay within 3-4 years with a job considered median from their standards and within 1-2 years if you get lucky and are well-networked.</br>
</br>
The problem arises if you want to do research or work on a specific project that you have zeroed in on beforehand. If the group you want to work on is too sought after, it gets tough to get in as grads from MIT, Cornell etc would be trying to do the same and there is a reasonable chance that you may not get into the lab of your choice. That messes up your career for at least 5-years if not more. </br>
</br>
Another thing is the size of the groups at these big schools at times is huge. 20-30 people is a reasonable possibility. As a grad student, you would not want to work under another grad student who is working under a postdoc, who in turn is working under one of the scientific officers, who meet the PI once a week, Kinda. Don't go for that group anywhere. </br>
</br>
So, pros and cons huh. Not a tough call statistically though. You would be at stanford by now. I would have done the same but everyone knows that anything can backfire. Absolutely anything. Therefore, best of luck with anything you end up doing. Do it well. Rest is all extraneous in the longer run I hear from the wiser folk.</br>
