The University of Texas at Austin, informally UT Austin, UT, University of Texas, or Texas in sports contexts, is a public research university and the flagship institution of the University of Texas System. Founded in 1883 as "The University of Texas," its campus is located in Austin, Texas-approximately 1 mile (1,600 m) from the Texas State Capitol. The institution has the fifth-largest single-campus enrollment in the nation, with over 50,000 undergraduate and graduate students and over 24,000 faculty and staff. The university has been labeled one of the "Public Ivies," a publicly funded university considered to provide a quality of education comparable to those of the Ivy League.</br>
UT Austin was inducted into the American Association of Universities in 1929, becoming only the third university in the American South to be elected. It is a major center for academic research, with research expenditures exceeding $550 million for the 2013-2014 school year. The university houses seven museums and seventeen libraries, including the Lyndon Baines Johnson Library and Museum and the Blanton Museum of Art, and operates various auxiliary research facilities, such as the J. J. Pickle Research Campus and the McDonald Observatory. Among university faculty are recipients of the Nobel Prize, Pulitzer Prize, the Wolf Prize, the Emmy Award, and the National Medal of Science, as well as many other awards.</br>
UT Austin student athletes compete as the Texas Longhorns and are members of the Big 12 Conference. Its Longhorn Network is unique in that it is the only sports network featuring the college sports of a single university. The Longhorns have won four NCAA Division I National Football Championships, six NCAA Division I National Baseball Championships and has claimed more titles in men's and women's sports than any other school in the Big 12 since the league was founded in 1996. Current and former UT Austin athletes have won 130 Olympic medals, including 14 in Beijing in 2008 and 13 in London in 2012.

question:德克萨斯州大学奥斯汀分校（University of Texas at Austin，UT Austin）成立于1883年，是德州大学系统中最主要的旗舰级大学，也是美国最好的公立学校之一。德克萨斯大学奥斯汀分校位于美国第二大州﹣德克萨斯州的首府奥斯汀，离德州州政府总部不足一里。现有学生人数50006（2009年秋季统计资料），为全美单一校园中学生人数中第五大的大学（1997-2003为全美人数最多的大学）；目前仍是全德州人数最多的大学。</br>

@许望伟</br>
其实已经说得挺详细的了。补充几点其他的。德州非常的热，经常看到好看的妹子在学校里面走来走去。据说UT Austin是全美好看妹子最多的学校，不知道是不是真的。学校体育馆很不错，可惜一直没时间去。UT Austin一直号称要做全美最好的公立大学，除了会计，pharmacy还有土木全美前三以外，其他的专业排名基本都是十几，不好不坏。德州第一，整个南方地区也是响亮的头牌，加州地区影响力也不错，不过北方人民基本不太感冒。尤其是花街上，声势不够浩大。校友给人印象很好，大家都很习惯留在德州，没有州税，房价便宜，Austin好玩的也很多（虽然不对中国人的胃口，但是缴税少终归是好事）</br>
建筑风格很统一，基本都是红色，主路上经常有小本搞各种活动。学校风格很亲民，没有所谓的贵族气息。淳朴这个词形容德州人民是绝对没错的，我就经常因为找不到路的时候会有人带路，这种在纽约这种城市都是不可以想象的。以前一直以为UT Austin身为州立大学，学风不怎么样。其实整体教学质量还是不错的，尤其是研究生院。</br>
学校还有一个research center在Austin，里面都是各种实验室，没有去过，具体不详。</br>
UT Austin在中国一直比较低调，一提起Texas很多人还想起电锯惊魂。这几年德州经济越来越好，Austin的高科技，休斯敦的石油能源，达拉斯的金融都是有很多工作机会的行业。我现在觉得除了特别热以外，UT Austin还是一所让人很爱的学校（最起码看着校园里面的各种肥松鼠都会心情大好）</br>

首先申明，为了避免误人子弟，我将拒绝回复任何关于申请的咨询。【我真的不知道xxxxSAT,xxGPA把握大不大。我们学校admission office很奇怪的】</br>
------</br>
然后收到offer了的小伙伴们陆续开始问我奥斯汀具体的情况。其实很多信息都能在我们UT CSSA的论坛上找到，欢迎大家来论坛 </br>
link: //link.zhihu.com/?target=http%3A//utcssa.net  </br>

utcssa.net</br>
 （可能需要翻墙）。CSSA也会提供免费的接机服务，并且建立新生交流群。收到了offer的学弟学妹们也可以私信我，我可以拉你们进新生微信群</br>
想了想貌似也没什么能说的... 无非就是吃喝玩乐+泡图书馆....</br>
吃：学校里有好几个食堂。 J2 和Kinsolving是自助餐，属于吃一周就腻了不想吃了的那种。别的稍微贵一点的食堂大概是吃两个星期就吃不下去了的样子... 今年4-5月份时为了省钱吃了将近一个月的食堂，钱包是鼓了点，胃差点要造反了= =</br>
但是！！！</br>
奥斯汀这个城市里好吃的很多！！</br>
学校旁边有著名的瓜街(Guadelupe)，上面全是各种餐馆。一般晚上不想吃食堂了就会去那吃。然后北边有家拉面馆，是在我吃了香港的一兰拉面，一风堂等拉面馆后依然觉得最赞的拉面！！然后就是离学校十分钟路程的Franklin Barbecue，奥巴马前段时间来奥斯汀都跑去吃这个了。【还插队】上次为了吃这个我和我的小伙伴排了4个小时的队。然后还有南边的Uchi ！！我吃过的最赞的日本寿司！吃了他家的寿司后，才知道三文鱼是如此的美味。回国后发现国内的寿司简直是吃不下去了 。【同时Uchi也相当贵...我4-5月份吃食堂就是因为吃uchi吃穷了....】</br>
喝：谈到喝自然是说喝酒...这个我自己接触的少，只能道听途说的表示奥斯汀有一条著名的酒吧街叫六街(six street)。有时节假日能喝酒的学长学姐们会去那喝喝酒聊聊天跳跳舞什么的。</br>
玩乐：这方面就跟其他国外高校没什么太大的区别了，每个人有每个人的兴趣爱好。我这一年的娱乐主要是跟小伙伴去某人家吃饭然后打uno - -。有时候一晚上不停地赢还是蛮爽的～。然后就是组织/参加各种CSSA举办的活动啦～有的活动像非诚勿扰还能看大美女！！</br>
泡图书馆：这个其实是最占时间的。因为宿舍就在学校最大的图书馆(PCL)旁边，所以每天晚上基本上吃完饭就在图书馆里，一直呆到凌晨才回寝室洗了睡。图书馆有六层，期末时真的能坐满- - 好像期末时还有人在图书馆搭了帐篷直接住进在六楼了。然后有时候开会也在图书馆里... 我们曾经笑话说如果学校有洗澡的地方，完全可以不用花钱住寝室，住图书馆妥妥的。</br>
------------------------------------------我是分割线----------------------------------------------</br>
最后给UT CSSA打个小广告～ CSSA秋季开学后会招新</br>
</br>
祖亚洲，Architect the Machine</br>
UT在中国的宣传很低调，这里有几个学员很厉害，比如石油工程、会计、EECS</br>
我就读的是Computer Engineering。今天刚出来的这个领域顶级会议HPCA(2015年的)一共接收51篇论文，其中7篇来自UT</br>
嘿嘿，掂量掂量吧</br>
我觉得Austin挺不错，UT是Austin的明珠，这是个有点小清新的城市，也是个高科技的城市（Intel, IBM, AMD, Apple, Oracle.. you name it,,,），更是个美女如云的城市</br>
相信我说的最后一句话没错的....</br>
</br>
Xu Wangwei，二级狗的行为艺术</br>
校园及周边环境的感觉像是国内的大学</br>
重视学术和科技创新，而商业气息和功利性淡，有比较合适的生活节奏</br>
相对于华人扎堆的大都市来说，这里西班牙语文化更多</br>
小清新的downtown，生活成本较低</br>
有阳光、妹子，没有海滩；有酒吧、音乐，没有足够的fun</br>
最大的好处德州人都很淳朴nice</br>
总体上，是一个丰富和自由的学校；但还是一个区域性强的学校，比上不足，比下有余</br>
如果嫌两岸太贵，欢迎来到南方。</br>
没有在别的学校好好待过，谈不上文化氛围的比较。</br>
一定要说的话，德州是非常保守的老派的，但Austin是德州中与众不同的带有自由主义的地方，随着越来越多的人口涌入，越来越多人参与到keep Austin weird这个口号中来</br>
反映到学校中来，innovative的气氛是可以感觉到的；而且学校比较喜欢有个性的特点的学生</br>
也许受到城市氛围圈的影响，有的学校会鼓励竞争，有的崇尚合作，我感觉UT是真的提倡团结合作，所以压力和节奏肯定要比常春藤学校小；加上体育文化的加持，有一支texas longhorn这种球队印记随处出现生活中，和Yale这种没有好球队的学校，体验肯定是不一样的。在求学之外，球队文化是传统美国式学校的很大一片亮点吧。</br>
你的圈子里能接触到的人的风格也会不同于大城市的学校。说白了文化这个东西和产业经济是相关的，东西部和中部不一样，能源圈创业圈的文化和金融圈IT圈的文化当然也会不一样。不过好好学习好好体验，总能成为自己想要成为的精英。</br>
</br>
楊琳，石油/ 在井上</br>
謝邀.個人經歷是從中部的私立小TU到了南部的公立大UT,從本科到研究生都是石油工程.</br>
公私立差別最大在于師生比和設施齊全與否.UT從當初的四十英畝發展到了如今的四百英畝(僅算市區的佔地面積),有了遍佈校園各處的圖書館和健身設施.或動或靜只在於你的選擇,設施全部不成問題.圖書館包括最大的綜合圖書館PCL,和隱藏在各科系大樓里的專業圖書館,加上好用的Interlibrary Loan,愛書的人基本不愁借不到想要的書.健身館方面,有最基本的健身器材跑道球類場地攀岩設施,室外室內(恆溫)游泳池SPA桑拿,豐富多彩的健身課程(踏板普拉提瑜伽拳擊NikeTraining),還會組織戶外遠足攀岩的活動,只要是你這裡的學生,就不需要去外面那些高大上的健身館交每個月五十刀的月費,UT就能滿足你的基本健身要求.校園範圍內還有幾個歷史藝術博物館,能滿足人文愛好者對於博物館深切的愛.ATT center每個月都會有一個Austin Forum,舉辦類似TED的演講活動.</br>
學術生活方面,就我們專業而言,本科的生活并不輕鬆.系裡面的教授不會只關注研究進展,也花費了很多心血準備教材投入教學活動(所以很少那種舊考卷萬事足的事情),也非常樂意幫助學生進步.我們系現在測井,鑽井,EOR還有現在最火的水力壓裂等方面都是走在科研的前端.本科的學生們都能直接參與這些教授開設的課程,大大保證了學以致用,和在知識上面的快速更新.今年我們系的鑽井平台模擬器已經安全完成了,本科的學生在不久的將來就能夠直接操作模擬器進行海上鑽井了. (原諒我還是忍不住拿出來炫耀一下.....)</br>
<img src = "https://pic3.zhimg.com/e0d01fd2e2f7275c2e7d48db833054d2_b.jpg  " />
研究生的課程負擔一點都不輕,碩士最起碼得修完八門課.每週的作業量,還有課外需要閱讀的論文等等.研究方面,因為UT本身擁有很多測試器材,個人接觸過的就有X-ray scan,SEM,TEM等等.基本上想做的常規測試,在UT校內都能夠解決(便宜又方便),這樣的靈活性的確是每個研究生夢寐以求的.石油系裡面有自己的machine shop,缺零件了,沒關係,3D打印給你一個...</br>

學校還提供很多Informal Class(要付費的),你可以學高爾夫,訓狗,養蜂,划船,騎馬,畫畫,跳舞,寫作,賣房子.這些是獨立于學校學分之外的課程,就像是國內的興趣班.這些課程向市民開放,作為學生,你擁有一點價格上的優惠,同時也是一個很好的社交平台.</br>
因為本身就讀研究生,接觸到比較多的國際學生.大家基本上都很友善,學術上的交流也很頻繁.日常生活里接觸的德州人也非常的大方豪爽,奧斯汀又是個提倡個性的地方,所以大家反而也不是那麼保守.在美國這幾年基本都在中南部,遇到的本地人都是非常友善的,也有聽說過朋友被邀請去當地人的農場做客的.只要要怎麼融入當地的文化,還是要看自己.</br>
最後還是得說說吃,誰叫我不務正業整天就知道吃呢.學校附近最為推崇的只有Taco Joint,吃到畢業都不會膩啊.至於學生要探索奧斯汀更多好吃的,只有一個誠摯的建議,車.在中南部生活,沒有車是走不動的,特別是德州,Everything is big in Texas.奧斯汀是一個非常富有活力的城市,她的開放性包容性和自由主義使她完全不同於德州其他的城市,散發著一種獨特的魅力.來到奧斯汀的這一年半,她教會了我熱愛生活,熱愛運動,勇於嘗試各種新鮮事物.同樣,我也感謝UT,以身為Longhorn而自豪~</br>
可能會有錯誤的地方,歡迎來糾錯.希望認識更多Longhorn們~也歡迎更多的人來到UT Austin,來到可愛迷人的奧斯汀.</br>

UT Austin是美国西南部公立大学里面的楚翘。</br>
商学院的本科生+研究生很难在Austin本地找到好工作。商学院就业率最好的是MPA和MBA。MPA全美第一，1年的program，出来至少4大保底。MBA呢，以前公司的几个老板都是McCombs的MBA，我也不多做评价，感觉挺能说的。总的来说，Austin金融类基础工作（Entry Level）机会少，而且竞争激烈。</br>
不过，众所周知，Austin是个科技城市，俗称小硅谷，如果是Computer Science专业，那你就来吧。</br>
很多人都说Austin是个liberal的城市。其实这个市城很white，那些酒吧，那些音乐节，一般的中国人也不见得喜欢。</br>
我在Austin工作过两年，当时住在UT北部的Triangle，出门开车5分钟，随便你往哪个方向开，就是各大超市（HEB，Wholefoods，Center Market）。Lamar和Guadalupe上面各式各样的小餐馆，好吃不贵,走几步就到。再加上认识了各式各样的朋友，每周周末都有活动，要么去六街喝酒，要么去boating，又或者去朋友家里一起做饭庆祝生日。因为城市小，大家约出门也很方便，只要说个时间地点，80%的人都会准时出现，no bullshit。这段生活经历让我从内心感受到 - everything is effortless here。粗俗一点，翻译过来就是做啥事都不费力- 去买吃的不费力，去交际也不费力，去downtown喝酒也不费力，工作上也不用太费力。穿上背心短裤，踩上人字拖，就可以去Austin的每一个地方，非常适合像我这种生性怕麻烦的人。</br>

UT Austin这个学校非常大，这里的大主要说的是人数多，所以本科生源质量没有私立学校那么精，如同其他州立大学一样，这直接影响了UT在USNEWS上的排名。但是请注意，UT的学术水平在国际上享有盛名，其在泰晤士报的世界大学排名中位列27名，这足以证明UT学术实力之强劲。且不说UT的学术实力和地位，就拿校友们在美国尤其是德州的影响力来说，那真的可以用巨擘来形容，UT的基金会在全美国是第二大的，仅次于哈佛，这是校友们实力的体现。</br>
UT是体育强校。每年有橄榄球比赛的时候，体育场内真真是一片橙色（学名Burn Orange，UT的校色）的海洋。。。上几张图吧。</br>

UT的McCombs的商学院到底在美国是个什么地位？相信这是很多同学的疑问，大多数人只听过哈佛沃顿斯坦福，不过可惜了，人家不招master，多数美国的顶尖商学院甚至连本科生都没有，只有MBA。UT的商学院是美国顶尖商学院里少数有master项目的，你可以说公立学校都缺钱，所以需要搞点圈钱的项目，不过我这一年读下来的感觉是：物有所值。McCombs到底有多牛呢？国内最好的公立商学院，北大的光华，和UT有联合培养MBA的项目，一般来说，实力相当的学校才会有联合培养，在国内通过考研上光华有多难，相信大家不是不知道，而且和光华联合培养双学位国际MBA最好的学校就是McCombs了（交流交换不算），这从一个侧面说明McCombs的实力。当然，我不否认光华在中国的地位和资源的集中度是McCombs在美国无法企及的，但是两校实力相当，应该是没有疑问。美国的商学院，有M7和S16之分，分别指商学院排名前7和前16的学校，可以说是大家dream company招聘的tier 1和tier 2，看2015年USNEWS商学院的排名，UT的McCombs商学院排在15位，甚至高于藤校康奈尔，也就是说，McCombs的实力是非常恐怖的。</br>
另外说说Austin这个城市，Austin可以说是美国人最喜欢的德州城市了吧，我认识的美国人说Austin比较像加州，一个是高科技产业发达，另外一个就是思想比较Liberal，不像德州其他地方那么保守（布什所代表的德州佬形象已经被美国人黑出翔了。。。）。在这住过的美国人都会爱上这里，我们叫Finance的老师就纽约人，在这定居了。另外就是物价相对其他州来说比较便宜，好吃的餐馆真心多又不贵，搞得我天天想饕餮。。。现在在Austin能看到在美国其他城市难得一见的施工工地，说明Austin正在崛起，用我们班Michigan来的同学的话说就是“The city is growing.”</br>

UT还是很良心的，学费较其他排名靠前的学校算非常低，奥斯汀的生活成本也很合理，总而言之我觉得是性价比很高的一个学校。当然如果你是土豪不在乎这个当我没说。</br>
法学院离主校区比较远，有一种遗世独立，啊不是，被遗弃的感觉。教授都是南部地区大牛。</br>
校园校车系统很发达，据说是仅次University of Michigan。但在我天朝看来，呵呵。</br>

ut是个不错的学校，挺务实挺靠谱的，你能想到的专业都还排得上号，整体的教育质量不错，只要不选文科基本不会作死（选文科的就跪着上吧。。。刚来时候累死累活US history只有A- 累觉不爱。）</br>
学校里75%是texas的人，一方面对ut认同感很强一方面有些人的确对外面的世界没什么了解，这辈子没出过texas的不在少数。</br>
BBQ很好次！！！</br>
学校动静相宜，而且据说很大～</br>
</br>

刚考完final来回答这个问题……</br>
我是本科生，就说说大概知道的情况。</br>
UT是个挺大的学校。由于比较大，前几个学期core curriculum的课班级人数会比较多，记得当年上各种301都是几百人的大班。但是到了upper level的话class size会瞬间缩小。这学期上了一门课才16个人。</br>
这里绝大多数都是德州本地的学生。德州本地大都是自动录取进来的。由于各校的教育水平参差不齐，自动录取来的人水平也是参差不齐的。当tutor的时候接触过一些上408k的，求个sin，cos都要反应半天（主要是商院的，趁机黑一下~），也接触过一些Dean's scholar(College of Natural Sciences的honor program)/Turing Scholar（CS的honor program），大一一进学校就上real analysis，然后各种选graduate course。私以为和那些顶尖学校比（ivy league之类的），UT的上限并不差，只是可能比较没有下限。</br>
身边认识的搞research的不在少数。UT虽然不能算美帝tier 1的学校，但是research绝对算得上第一档。从FRI到后面各种lab，Eureka一个关于research的数据库只要输入关键词就可以找到相关方向的faculty。library也很给力。我曾经在PCL翻出过《新青年》，《毛选》，《人民日报》等作品。UT搞的这个东西啊，excited！曾经有professor说undergraduate research是UT的一大卖点，faculty的工资都是按科研成就开出来的，不玩玩就亏了。我个人试着找过一位,他们都还挺爱带本科生玩的（可能是因为算廉价劳动力吧）。</br>
课余生活也其实挺丰富的。个人行走在CSSA的边缘，就是没加CSSA但是认识一些人。每年春秋季开学之前各种社团和兄弟姐妹会都在招人。那场面，真是红旗招展……（具体参见宋丹丹小品）</br>
校外上面已经有人提到瓜街好吃的很多，但是感觉好像除了亚洲风味和墨西哥风味就没什么新鲜的了。6街要21岁再说。</br>
我是从北京来的，感觉Austin还蛮不错的，大小比较合适又没有北京那么喧闹。生活节奏也合适。除了夏天热点，冬天气温不太稳定之外没什么弊端。Startup的聚集使得Austin成为了年轻人的地方，各种活动层出不穷，You will never get bored in Austin.</br>
题干部分指出体育，我觉得UT的football这几年好像表现实在一般，胜率一直稳定在50%左右，但是德州人民实在热情，10W人的体育场DKR到比赛日的时候真的能坐满，全场burnt orange（LZ本来有图的但是手机不给力），有一种深深的school pride扎根其中。我严重怀疑美帝就是用这种无耻的方式培养学生对母校的归属感的。而且听说Game day的时候酒店等配套服务也会相应涨价，估计也是拉动Austin经济的一个原因吧。</br>

美国德克萨斯州奥斯汀，有着得天独厚的自然地理环境，科罗拉多河蜿蜒流经这里，使丘陵地带分布了许多的湖泊。美丽的河畔、湖边，是人们垂钓、露营、漫步、骑自行车的好地方。清澈幽静的河流湖泊，是人们划船泛舟、潜水游泳的极佳地方。常年的户外活动，丰富着人们的美好生活，而无数美丽的人造喷泉和壮观的天然瀑布也是锦上添花，使人感到美不胜收。</br>
在奥斯汀，居住着数万华人，有着许多华人社团组织，“奥斯汀华人学生学者联谊会”就是其中一个，我们也经常应邀参加他们的各种活动，结交朋友、丰富生活。在奥斯汀，我们一个公园又一个公园地游览参观，与中国留学生同学和当地的华人朋友在公园聚餐烧烤、交际娱乐。观赏湖水中嬉戏的天鹅和单人或双人划艇的追逐，远处是飞驰而过的摩托艇和豪华游艇，常常是流连忘返。这奥斯汀还有一绝，有上百万只的墨西哥无尾蝙蝠，它们聚集在横跨奥斯汀市的一座大铁桥上，在夕阳下，可看到它们上下纷飞，极为壮观奇特。</br>
在奥斯汀游览，画龙点睛之处是登上 Bonn hell山，在山顶俯瞰美丽的湖泊和岸边景观，那些湖畔的高档别墅，更加引人注目。每家每户的住宅、庭院，如诗如画，你可从我拍射的照片中欣赏到这一美景。一栋栋别墅坐落在湖边，房屋样式，各具特点。除了一般别墅都有的车库之外，这里的每家都有河道直通自己的院子，自家的游艇或停在有棚、厦的家庭港湾中，或已载着主人在湖面泛舟航行。</br>

cmu ece到底选课怎样真是众说纷纭啊，而且那边应该都是往软件方面找工作，之前我也是狂热于要转cs，但仔细一想，其实我更多的积累还是比较偏底层的。有个学长是UTA CAEP MS，第一年暑假的时候去了intel实习，拿了return offer  他说他那一届找工作都挺不错的，去cisco dell的很多</br>
</br>
Josh</br>
楼主不喜欢写代码吗？如果不喜欢写代码的话Austin CAEP的确是最好的选择，可以进硬件公司，但如果想转软件方向的CMU绝对是首选啊，ECE的课就跟上CS似的，对以后找软件方面的工作很好。现在这社会啥都跟软件沾边，楼主喜欢硬件可以软硬结合，搞嵌入式系统之类的什么</br>
</br>
ljjloselsbut</br>
我挺喜欢写代码的，但写的都比较偏底层，以c/c++ 为主，最近在实习单位做opencl方面的东西，挺喜欢的。我自己也写网站什么的，但只是玩一玩。而且我挺讨厌GUI的东西的，我能说我现在就是在用Emacs的w3m-mode上网回帖的吗~~所以我觉得纯软件也未必非常适合我呢，确实想往你说的软硬件结合方向发展</br>

问题内容:</br>
前天收到了PURDUE一个老师的RA。想在有点纠结。所以想听听大家的建议，特别是在这两所学校学长和申请的前辈们。我申请的方向两个：VLSI/CAD+COMPUTER ARCHITECTURE</br>
</br>
PURDUE： RA 1600/month + TW. 钱也比较少。老师的方向是VLSI/CAD。</br>
</br>
关于PURDUE，有不少人说这个学校在走下坡路。另外，我对给我RA的那个老师也不是很了解，人似乎水平还不错，但我并不清楚和他一起工作会不会顺利，他是否push我也不清楚。他主页上找不到他学生的联系方式，所以这方面的信息了解不到。还有一个问题就是，purdue选导师的方式是怎么样的呢？像这种他给我发了第一年的RA，是不是表明我必须一直跟他了。如果我一年后去找别的导师，会不会有什么新的问题？ purdue允许这种情况么？ 最后就是purdue的经费似乎特别紧张。我怕第二年找不到钱了，如果我又不想继续跟这个老师的话。而且RA的钱似乎不多。知道如果我找不到后续的funding,我能拿一个MS走掉，去申请别的学校么？</br>
当然优势就是：有奖，学校在ECE的名声还是不错的。</br>
</br>
奥斯汀申请的是CAEP track的MS，面试之后一度幻想能有个MS OFFER，但无奈还是只有AD。我觉得这边的主要优势是：1.我不用着急定具体老师？可以有十分多的选择。AUSTIN的VLSI/CAD，computer architecture都很好, ECE十分全面。2. MS毕业可以工作，或者申请更好的学校，留在AUSTIN 继续PHD也是不错的选择。3.AUSTIN在这个领域确实比较强。</br>
这边的问题主要有：1.自费花钱。20W/YEAR</br>
</br>
想听听大家的建议。不甚感谢！</br>

拿了ra，就得给这个老师干活，而且干活期间联系其他老师，是大忌，如果被这个老师知道了，奖学金可能就被停了，而且你的目标老师可能未必愿意要你，不想显得自己挖同事墙角</br>
如果他没钱了，而且对你也满意，自然会帮你争取ta，如果有风险会拿不到，你正好顺利成章要他的推荐信走人，这就不是你的责任了。</br>
austin非常便宜，性价比也很高</br>

What is it like to be a UT Austin computer science student?</br>
Answer:</br>
For me, there's not one word that can describe what it's like to be a UTCS student, but the closest one that I could think of is incredible.</br>
</br>
I could talk your ear off about why I love our department. I used to say my department, but as the years have gone on, it's truly our department. The UTCS department is one of the most welcoming places that I've ever been to. In 3 years, I've had an incredible journey. I'll try to keep this answer short (it won't be). (There's a tl;dr at the end)</br>
</br>
As a high school senior, I didn't want to attend UT. Strange, right? I wanted to go out of state, not to some state school 2 hours from home. Meeting Dr. Calvin Lin changed my life. I don't think he knows, but someone should tell him that - he changes students' lives. There are tons of professors at UT like that. For me, Dr. Lin made me feel so welcome and wanted. I think that's something that differentiates the UTCS department - we want our students. He made me feel like if I chose to go somewhere other than UT for college, I would truly be missed. Like, Elynn Lee would be missed, not just some applicant, some number would be missed. And it's true - from the get go, the department welcomes incoming and prospective students. We want our students. Coming from someone who, at times, didn't feel like they had a place where the felt wanted, this was a huge plus for me.</br>
</br>
As a college freshman, I was terrified. I was doing alright in college, but not blowing everyone else out of the water. I wasn't confident. I wanted to do something in my community, in the department, but I didn't know how. I remember going to my advisor, Rob, all the time and asking him for help or clarifications on advising. I've always felt like I had a guardian angel in Rob - he always knew what to say and how to fix my problems. He encouraged me to continue dreaming and doing what I felt would make our department better. He supported my endeavours. This is another amazing thing about our department - administrators listen to the students. I would bring ideas to Rob and he'd help make them a reality. My advisor (at the time, we only had 2 advisors for a 1500 student department, mind you) made time for me and boosted my confidence. This is very true of the advisors that we have in our department - I always feel supported, even when I'm doing something that's kind of out there or even when there's pushback. Our advising and academics staff is incredible! I could tell millions of stories about them and how much they truly care about their students. It's incredible to study in a department where the administrators also care about student progress and happiness.</br>
</br>
Let's talk about professors and academics. People like to give us flack because we're a state school... and I guess that's fine, because they don't study here and don't know what it's really like. The courses here are challenging, but not because professors are unreasonable or want to see students fail. No, it's actually quite the opposite. Professors in the UTCS Department want to see students succeed and be all that they can be. After being on the teaching staff for a class, I can truthfully say that everyone is really concerned with making sure students are learning and improving. I've met and interacted with a number of professors in the department. They absolutely love the students and love talking with them both in and outside of the classroom. Not only that, but professors like Dr. Lorenzo Alvisi truly love the material that they're teaching. I've never been a systems person; I've always done internships in web development or at least something more front end focused. Any professor who can make me not only understand but love a class like distributed computing is an incredible professor. I love our teaching staff; everyone is so approachable and readily available and really willing to help students succeed.</br>
</br>
I can't even begin to talk about the opportunities. I kind of don't want to. There are awesome opportunities at a number of universities, and the only reason I mention opportunities at UT in this answer is really just to show that we have them. The opportunities are incredible and plentiful. There are so many resources for career development - whether you want to go into academia, startups, internships, game development, teaching, etc. So, having all of these opportunities in front of us is incredible too!</br>
</br>
The last thing I want to mention is the student body. There are so many incredibly passionate and welcoming students. And, you can always find someone who'll help you out or someone who's doing really awesome research. In the new Bill and Melinda Gates Computer Science Complex has so many spaces for students to work together and interact. This answer is already really long, but the students in our department are incredible and doing really insanely awesome things!</br>
</br>
I could go on, but this already sounds like a plug. No one has to pay me to say these kinds of things. I'm so proud to be a Longhorn! HOOK 'EM HORNS!</br>
</br>
</br>
tl;dr:</br>
I could go on and on and on about what it's like to be in a department as great as ours. But, in a nutshell, this is what it's like to be a UTCS student:</br>
I feel supported.</br>
I feel empowered.</br>
I feel like everyone in the department (from students to faculty to staff) is concerned with helping me improve and succeed.</br>
I feel wanted.</br>
I feel surrounded by students who not only are doing amazing things, but also push me to be a better student.</br>
</br>
If you're applying to UT Austin (especially as a CS student), schedule a tour! I lead up the Ambassador program at UT and we'd love to show you around :)</br>
Answer:</br>
have a somewhat different perspective on this subject. I was never a UT Austin CS student, but I was an adjunct (part time) faculty member at UT Austin CS and I was a member of the department's industry advisory board for about four years. I have also been a computer science accreditation program evaluator for over 25 years and have visited about 25 CS programs in that capacity (not UT). </br>
</br>
At our UT Austin CS industry advisory board meetings, the board would interview groups of students to see what they liked and disliked about the department and the program. Most board members also had the advantage of seeing many other CS programs / departments around the country, so we could compare.  From that perspective, the most overwhelming facts about the UT Austin CS situation are: 1) the program is BIG (lots of faculty members; lots of classes with lots of students in them; many choices for elective courses) and 2) relative to other large programs, it does a very good job of supporting the students and helping them achieve success.  </br>
</br>
If you compare UT Austin CS with smaller programs, the smaller ones tend to give more individual student attention and have classes that are smaller. For example. I've taught at some small schools where an advanced class, such as operating systems, might have 15 students and might be taught once a year. At UT Austin, when I taught that class, I had over 150 students in my section and there were several sections of the course each semester!</br>
</br>
If you compare UT with other large programs, I would say that UT does a much better than average job of supporting the students and helping them deal with the sheer magnitude of the school and the program.  Unfortunately, some other large programs tend to be less focused on their undergraduates. For example, many large schools use graduate students who cannot speak English well for teaching many of the undergraduate courses.  At UT there is less of that.</br>
</br>
When considering a large program or a small one, each individual student should consider which of the two they would prefer. Having more classmates and more sections of the course means more people to interact with and more choices (you can avoid certain professors, for example).  On the other hand, having a small class tends to promote more of a team atmosphere. You tend to know everyone in the class, as they all take the same classes with you along the way.</br>
</br>
One UT Austin student put it very well in his interview with the industry advisory board: "the university teaches you about the real world - they throw you into this gigantic environment that's radically different from high school and sometimes you feel like nobody gives a damn about you, but you learn to cope and it helps you grow and prepare yourself for the outside world."</br>
</br>
One of the good things about CS education in the US is that we have hundreds of high quality computer science programs, each with their own characteristics. I encourage students to do good research before deciding what program to enroll in.</br>
<div class="anchor-list"><a name="4_2" class="lemma-anchor para-title"></a></div><div class="para-title level-3"><h3 class="title-text"></br>Question:</br></h3></div>
What is the undergraduate computer science program at UT Austin like?</br>
Answer:</br>
The UTCS program is awesome. This is a pretty open-ended question so I guess I'll just go through what I imagine are the basics that anyone wants to know about any program. </br>
</br>
Professors - Our professors and lecturers are awesome. I won't lie, they aren't all 10/10, you get the occasional bad professor like you would at any other school. But in my time at UTCS, I've had some really thorough and awesome professors and there are still a lot of professors who people absolutely rave about that I haven't taken yet. </br>
</br>
Curriculum - Our curriculum is pretty standard and similar to any of the top-tier CS programs. From what I've heard, UTCS is known for having a really strong theoretical curriculum, since we were originally branching off from the Math department. We have a CS core requirements you must take, but they leave room for a lot of interesting CS electives. </br>
</br>
Degrees - We offer BSA (Bachelor of Science & Arts), BS (Bachelor of Science), BA (Bachelor of Arts). We also have a Honors degree which means you've graduated from the Turing Scholars program (a honors program for CS majors focused on research). </br>
</br>
Student organizations - I'm a bit biased because I'm in like 4 different CS organizations and love every single one. I talk specifically about student organizations at UT in this answer: What are the The University of Texas at Austin Department of Computer Science student organizations and what do they do? </br>
</br>
One org that I failed to mention in that answer because it's new this year is Freetail Hackers. We are the org that plans and hosts HackTX every year, and we've expanded into a student organization so we can put on awesome smaller hackathon events throughout the year, as well as encourage others to contribute to the hacker community & go to other hackathons. (Hacker does not mean we're going to condone hacking into the NSA mainframe, it means we love to build/create things). </br>
</br>
Another new organization is Undergraduate Machine Learning. They also just started up this year and want to foster a community around those interested in machine learning and teach people how to implement ML algorithms. I don't know too much about this org or machine learning, so I'll leave it at that so I don't say anything untrue. </br>
</br>
Undergraduate Research - There's a lot of room for undergraduate research. In the College of Natural Sciences, there's a program called Freshman Research Initiative (FRI) which has freshmen take research classes in a specific track that they apply into in the spring semester of their frosh year. They get to actually work in the labs and with the grad students and professors doing research in those areas. If they choose to continue with it, they take the 2nd part in the fall semester of their sophomore year. </br>
</br>
Outside of FRI, lots of professors are open to undergrads who approach them and express interest in their research. I know quite a few people who do undergraduate research. </br>
</br>
The community - I really love the UTCS community. I can't tell you how many upperclassmen scooped me up as a small, timid freshman and gave me the courage and advice I needed to go after what I wanted. People offer to practice interview questions with you or to get coffee to talk about their experiences at certain companies. I expressed interest in one guy's personal project and he told me to fork it from his Github and play around with it and asked me to help port it over to use ReactJS. Lots of student organizations do tutoring or mentor programs for the entry-level programming classes and they're all super open and friendly. I've seen so many instances of people helping each other in the labs, studying together in offices and just generally supporting each other and having a lot of fun. It's a big department, there will always be a group of people you click with. </br>
</br>
Career opportunities - Our career fair is technically the College of Natural Sciences career fair, but it might as well just be named the CS career fair. I can't remember the exact number of employers that are represented there, the number is either 100 or 200. But 98% of them are looking for CS majors. They also do a LOT of recruiting just within our own building. There are so many career opportunities here and an alumni network of people in grad school, in the 5 year masters program, in the worlds top tech companies, in the start up communities around the country, etc.</br>
</br>
Hope this helped you learn more about UTCS! I could go on for a really long time.</br>
<div class="anchor-list"><a name="4_3" class="lemma-anchor para-title"></a></div><div class="para-title level-3"><h3 class="title-text"></br>Question:</br></h3></div>
How do resources for UT Austin computer science students compare to those at other elite CS departments?</br>
I'm a prospective out-of-state student looking at honors programs and other opportunities at UT Austin as a great alternative to other elite CS programs.</br>
Answer:</br>
Howdy!</br>
</br>
The University of Texas at Austin is a great school - for some, they may consider it an alternative, but it's definitely worthy of being a top pick school. Honestly, once I got here, I couldn't believe that this was my "back-up" school - it's amazing here and a silent force to be reckoned with. Prepare for a bit of a lengthy answer (which isn't surprising, coming from me when I talk about UT - there are lots of good things to say!).</br>
</br>
This is an interesting question, because it not only asks about the resources, but also about how they compare with those of other universities' departments. Let me preface my answer by saying that I deeply respect all of the CS departments that you are likely considering. Through my internships, I have made tons of friends from other universities (top 10 schools and not top 10 schools) who are all incredibly amazing at what they do and who teach me new things whenever I talk to them. Every school has something awesome to offer. Let me also stress that once you've looked at all the stats on paper, please visit the departments. Seriously, do it. That's what sealed the deal for me at UT. If you're interested in visiting the UTCS department, we have a program called the CS Ambassadors that schedules and gives tours to prospective students. I'm in charge of it, and we give over 100 tours a year (plus about 50 in the summer). It's awesome, just do it, if you email the address on that page, I'll probably be the one responding to the email.</br>
</br>
Anyways... on to your actual question :)</br>
</br>
There are a ton of resources at UT, both academic and non-academic. I'm going to assume you care more about the academic ones, but I will list as many non-academic (or non-CS) related resources as reasonably possible afterwards. I also wrote this answer a while back (What is it like to be a UT Austin computer science student?), if that interests you :)</br>
</br>
CS-related or potentially of academic interest to you</br>
Honors Program(s) - You mentioned honors programs in the description. Within the CS department, we have the Turing Scholars program, which is a CS specific honors program. We have about 150 students currently in the program (of the 2000+ total students). While honors program might make you perk up, the real purpose of this honors program is for the students to do research and write an undergraduate research thesis. I'm doing mine in CS education and following the previous president's research in the same area. The program is pretty competitive to get in to, but there are rewards in the form of small honors classes, events just for Turing Scholars, smaller community, and etc. Alternatively, the traditional program is also incredibly strong - you don't get to be a top 10 department based only on an honors program, and I can't stress that enough. I think the strongest draws for Turing are the research/thesis combo and the smaller community. UTCS is within the College of Natural Sciences, meaning that as a CS major, you can also be in the Dean's Scholars program. Dean's Scholars is a college-wide (as in College of Natural Science and not university-wide) honors program that brings together students from different science disciplines. I'm not sure of the size, though I believe it's slightly larger than Turing. Dean's Scholars follows a different degree plan from the regular BS/BA/BSA in CS do, but it's a really wonderful program from what I hear. If you're interested in pre-med, this is also a good place for you to look if you want to do your undergrad in CS.</br>
Research - I wrote a very, very short answer about research in our department (What kind of interesting research is going on at University of Texas Austin in the field of Computer Science?), but this is one of the areas that I think UTCS doesn't get enough credit for. Just like well known private institutions, UTCS does a lot of cutting edge and interesting research. And no - it's not at a "lesser" level just because we're a public school :) One of the greatest benefits of UT in general is that you get the perks of a small, research institution while also experiencing the large community of a large, public university. That sounds like a marketing ploy, but I assure you that it's true. The research that's being done at UT is really great and there's way more that's being done than I can list. Basically, anything you want to do research in, there's someone who can help you out. In particular, I know that our theory, AI, and systems labs are really, really great. We're also doing some CS education stuff, which is usually hard to find. UT also has the Freshman Research Initiative (FRI), which helps introduce freshmen in all disciplines in the College of Natural Sciences to research (non-CNS majors can get in too if there is space, I think). I started in FRI in a bioinformatics lab (and then moved to a computational epidemiology lab through the FRI alumni rotation program), but we also have labs within the CS department. It's a great way to get into CS research or experiment (no pun intended) in another department. It's an incredible program that started at UT and is being replicated in other universities!</br>
New CS building - We have a GORGEOUS new CS building (thanks Bill Gates, Michael Dell, President Powers, Dr. Moore, Dr. Porter, Patti Spencer, and etc). Not only are the labs and work spaces incredible, but the community that is fostered within the building is unlike any other. I have said this very often - different departments have different environments and personalities. Some are more competitive between individuals, some are more group oriented. Neither is better than the other; it's all about fit (which is why I implore you to visit the schools rather than only looking at the name). The UTCS community is one that fosters collaboration and innovation - and that's reflected in our students and the facilities we have. We're all about working together to be something better; because we know that what starts here changes the world.</br>
Start-up and Hacker Culture - Although I'm personally not a very start-up-y kind of person, we have a LOT of support for people who are interested in start-ups. I wrote a more thorough answer (Elynn Lee's answer to What colleges should a CS major consider for undergrad, if he/she ultimately wants to create a startup?) that lists some of the cool stuff we have at UT for people interested in start-ups. From student orgs, to incubators in town, to courses within the department and interdisciplinary programs, we have a lot of support. I've seen a lot of universities that are focused on either research/academics or start-ups, but at UT, you don't have to choose. Both initiatives are strong and will prepare you well for the future.</br>
CS student orgs - With a 2000+ CS population, we have a wonderful mix of students. This list hasn't been updated, but some of our student organizations can be found on this page (that will hopefully be updated soon). For sure, I know we're missing Mobile App Development (MAD), Special Interest Group on Security, Audit, and Control (SIGSAC), Society of Student Developers (SDEV), and StartATX.</br>
CS certificates and programs - I don't have a terribly long paragraph for this, but our department offers certificates in game development and security. So, if you complete the courses in these particular tracks, you'll have a better understanding of the corresponding subject. But, if you take a few and decide that you want to branch out, they all count for the degree plan! Pretty neat deal. Comment if you'd like more information on this; it's pretty specialized, but I'd be happy to provide more information!</br>
Access to Professors - A lot of top universities give great access to professors, and UT is no different. A good number of prospective students (and their parents) are surprised to hear that UTCS students are able to talk to professors pretty much whenever they want (within reason) and it's not unusual for the professors to know your name. I haven't taken a class with nearly every professor in our department, but I do know a good number of them just from passing, events, or organizations.</br>
Friends of Computer Science and Recruiting/Internships - FoCS is a group of companies who have pledged money to the UTCS department because they are especially interested in our students. The group is fairly large, so there are events all the time for UTCS students to meet recruiters and engineers from various companies from start-ups to established companies, product-based to web-based companies, and everything in the middle. We have an incredible Career Expo in both the fall and spring. While the exact number of employers varies each year, somewhere on the order of 130+ of the 150+ companies are looking for CS majors (with probably about 95% of them taking interns). And, if you're concerned about names, UT is a top 10 school, so our resumes go in the same basket as the other top 10 schools.</br>
First Year Pods - Because it's a large university, UT does all that it can to create smaller communities for students so that they can have the best of both worlds. They started a CS specific program this year that groups first year students (freshmen and transfers) into smaller "pods" led by an upperclassman. This allows first year students to meet other students in the same major who are going through the same classes and etc that they are as well as learn new things each week about the department and other CS concepts.</br>
Business Foundations Certification - If you're interested in getting an MBA or taking business classes at our incredible and top-ranked business school (the McCombs School of Business), you're able to! This is open to all non-business majors (we have an equivalent program in CS for non-CS majors), and a good number of our students participate in this program. More information can be found at the  Business Foundations Certificate website.</br>
Outreach - I could talk for ages about this initiative, but I'll try to be brief. If you're interested in K-12 CS/STEM outreach, we have that! It's maybe not a selling point for your college education, but it's something that I've always been interested in, so being able to start this initiative in my department and provide an outlet for other students is really cool to me.</br>
</br>
Non-CS specific or General UT resources</br>
FIGs and Residential FIGs - FIGs are "First-Year Interest Groups". They're similar to the pods I described earlier, except they're populated by students of different majors and the students take classes together [1]. Students in residential figs also live in the same residence hall and often in a cluster in Whitis Court or in the same hall. The Women in Engineering residential FIG is housed in the Littlefield dorm, one of the two all-girls dorms on campus. I believe that resdential FIGs are mainly focused on fostering community, so sometimes they don't take classes together.</br>
UTeach and UTeach Outreach - If you're interested in getting a teaching certificate for middle/high school (especially in a STEM area), UTeach is a great opportunity for you! The UTeach website will give you more information, but it's an incredible program that I really wish I had known about when I started at UT. It's also being replicated across the country!</br>
Non-Academic Advisors and Counseling - Not much to say here other than that we have incredible counselors and mental/emotional support. College is stressful. Our advisors are amazing. We often overlook these kinds of resources when looking at schools, but, especially after coming to college, I think they're super important. At UT, you are cared for by your professors and the staff that are here. As a member of the teaching staff for a course in the CS department, I went to a seminar relating to mental health of the students we would be working with. The extent to which the university cares is wonderful, amazing, and heart-warming. Let's not forget about this part of college :)</br>
Double Majoring - You're able to double major at UT! Woot! If you're in CS, you ARE able to double major in EE (and vice versa), among other majors. It's just a question I get asked a lot.</br>
Student Orgs - We have (literally) thousands of student orgs. They're great for social events, finding a cause you're passionate about, politics, cultural organizations, religious groups, and etc. Some of my favorites (either that I've been a part of, have friends in, or just think are funny) include China Care, the lock picking club, FaceAIDS, SURGe (Student Undergraduate Research Group), EChO (Engineering Chamber Orchestra), and many more! And, if you can't find a student org for it, you can start one!</br>
Study Abroad - We also have a fantastic study abroad program. Enough said.</br>
</br>
</br>
Hope this helps! Comment if you need more clarification on anything. And, feel free to A2A me any more UTCS questions - I'm more than happy to answer them!</br>
</br>
BTW: Thanks for all the A2A's! I was busy with Christmas and New Year's stuff, so this took a while to write :) I really needed to block out a couple of hours to think of everything and write everything down... but yea. I know I forgot something; I'm sure there will be edits haha</br>
</br>
[1] I'm not sure if they'll change it for next year or not, but in the pilot year of the pods, not everyone who was in the same pod was in the same class or even enrolled in the same class but in different sections.</br>
Answer:</br>
Most resources at a school in a given tier are mostly comparable, so I'll try to focus on what I'd consider as differentiated offerings what made me decide to go to UT, and what in retrospect was valuable.</br>
</br>
The important things:</br>
</br>
Faculty:</br>
</br>
First and foremost, you need access to faculty. They are the ones who will mould you and influence how much you love the subject. It is by far the single most important resource by a huge margin for any university.</br>
</br>
If there is one factor that makes a program what it is, it's the faculty, so pay a lot of attention to it. Everything else is mostly noise.</br>
</br>
One general rule of thumb with UT is that it's got an excellent endowment, but a lot of students, so the resources are top notch, but the ratio of students to resources is not.</br>
</br>
Faculty is a great example of this - the faculty is great but the student to faculty ratio isn't great. As a result, it's setup in a way that the early part of the program is filled with large weed out classes, and it's only when you get to the upper division classes do you get closer access to most of the research faculty.</br>
</br>
You have to fight to get courses with the good professors though - this means often classes with the good professors often fill up quickly, and you need a little bit of luck to register for the best classes.</br>
</br>
This is the single most valuable resource that will help you be inspired and learn, and beyond that your own success is up to you.</br>
</br>
Other than the difficulty of getting classes with good professors, I had no real complaints. There are areas where UT isn't specialized enough to take a large spectrum of classes in a given area ( e.g. there was only one graphics class ), but that's going to be a problem with just about any school. The best you can do is just learn about what areas a school offers classes in and what areas of faculty are aligned with what you want to do ( which is tricky since some of this you don't know before hand ).</br>
</br>
I would say talk to current students and look at course schedules of schools if you are in a situation where you need to decide between schools.</br>
</br>
Tution</br>
</br>
UT has plenty of on campus jobs. Particularly if you are an international student, you can get in state tuition if you pursue a research or teaching job.</br>
</br>
Between this and an internship, you can actually be mostly self sufficient in school, and that's great. I graduated with zero student debt.</br>
</br>
It's not a make or a break item since CS jobs pay pretty well even at an entry level but at the time you are a student, this really helps.</br>
</br>
Natural warmth:</br>
</br>
You don't have to freeze your butt off in Austin compared to a lot of other top 10 CS schools.</br>
</br>
I was accepted to other top 10 schools, though tution coupled with me not liking the cold was the tiebreaker for me. Of course, I was naive and, I didn't know anything about finding out about faculty, though no real regrets there.</br>
</br>
Career opportunities:</br>
</br>
UT does pretty well with respect to bringing late stage startups, medium sized employers and larger companies to campus, but it lacks a little bit of access to early stage startups and stronger geographically undiluted alumni ties.</br>
</br>
UT isn't a bad option in terms of access to startups, but it has nowhere near the same level of exposure as being in the Bay Area.</br>
</br>
On that note, if you are a self starter and look for jobs by yourself at companies that don't come to campus, it should not be a problem, see my answer here:</br>
</br>
Is a CS degree from UT-Austin respected in the valley/among startups?</br>
</br>
Generally speaking, most students aren't aware of just how startups work well enough or just how much better the startup opportunities are in the Bay. Even a simple sign in the CS building that just said "for the best career opportunities, you should move to the Bay Area the day you wrap up" would personally have helped a lot of students. A lot of people get scared about real estate prices in California or settle for the larger employers in Seattle based on the largest paycheck or just really like Austin and just continue to stay there.</br>
</br>
I did an internship in the Bay Area which made it unambiguously clear that the best software opportunities are here, but it was still an uphill battle to persuade a my friends to move here over job offers from Seattle or Austin based companies. Years later they are grateful that I did have those conversations with them and persuaded them.</br>
</br>
So just keep it at the back of your mind that despite the opportunities on campus being plentiful and convenient, there are lots of great opportunities you are qualified for that you have to chase after independently.</br>
</br>
Classmates:</br>
</br>
Your classmates are important because they influence you and are also a reflection of the school, and hence an indirect reflection of you. Plus they are a circle of friends you'll be able to call up for the rest of your life.</br>
</br>
They will also set the tone for how seriously you take your coursework and how competitive you are.</br>
</br>
UT's incoming class profile is not too impressive at the undergraduate level because of a policy that is very lax when it comes to admitting state students, but rest assured by the time someone gets to the junior and senior year, they have been subjected to a lot of rigorous and challenging coursework.</br>
</br>
For anyone who isn't serious about it or doesn't have the innate ability to do it, pursuing CS at UT will feel like a minefield.</br>
</br>
The unimportant things:</br>
</br>
Everything else is a commodity - honors programs, buildings, equipment, CS student organizations, double majoring, study abroad and whatever else.</br>
</br>
I thought they were cool when I was there and  participated in / made use of them, but honestly when I look back, they are fluff. Don't be enamored by them or pay any attention to them.</br>
</br>
In fact, if I could do things differently, in some cases I would opt out of a couple of the honors classes and pick more applied courses instead. Perhaps if you want to pursue academia or impress your parents, you could go for them but amongst all my classes, they were probably the least valuable.</br>
</br>
Equipment is in the larger scheme of things is a complete commodity. A vanilla laptop is more than enough to run whatever programming tools you need today. Buy one and program in the peace and quiet of your own dorm.</br>
</br>
Student CS organizations are also mostly a commodity, and every school will have their own flavor of them. There are some exceptions here ( perhaps BASES at Stanford might be a standout example ). Sure UT has them and I participated in them, and while they don't hurt, they are also fluff.</br>
</br>
In general, high quality people are the single most expensive resource when it comes to anything related to computer science and programming, and that's exactly what you should focus on when it comes to choosing schools, and particularly when you get to upper division coursework, UT does a great job there.</br>
Answer:</br>
I'm currently a senior at UT Austin. Though I can't do a compare and contrast to other elite universities, I'll do my best to share my experience at UT in an impartial way. Since you're asking about the "resources" particularly, I'll talk about the faculty, facility and student organizations. </br>
</br>
also check out What is it like to be a UT Austin computer science student?</br>
</br>
My favorite part about UTCS is the faculty. I can't thank them enough for everything they've done for me beyond academics. Neither of my parents finished high school so I can't really ask them about graduate schools or career advice. I turned to my professors, and every single one of them went out of their way to help me. They stayed after office hours to talk to me about their personal experiences, ask me the difficult questions and help me figure out what's best for my future. On a campus of over 50,000 students, in a department of over 2000 students, they made me feel like I wasn't just another face in the crowd. I truly believe that "help will always be given at [UT Austin] to those who ask for it." (a quote by a wise man)</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
There have been many nights where I had to stay past 3am at the lab to finish up an assignment or two. The Gates Dell Complex makes it tolerable. Around finals time, when libraries are filled with tents and sleeping bags, this building provides plenty of spaces (and white boards) for CS students to study. Good chairs, good computers, good whiteboards, what else can a CS student ask for?</br>
</br>
Since the department is growing tremendously, the number of student organizations is also growing to accommodate the variety of interests/population in this field. There's an organization for minorities, mobile apps developers, security enthusiasts, video games developers, and if I'm not mistaken, UTCS has the largest student chapter of ACM in the nation. </br>
</br>
I highly recommend an on campus tour before making a decision, since it's the best way to experience a university you're about to spend a couple of years at. </br>
</br>
Good luck!</br>
Answer:</br>
I didn't go to undergrad at UT and I'm CE, not CS, but no one has answered this yet. I've A2A'ed Elynn Lee and Alex Suchman but they're probably busy with holiday stuff, so you should probably wait for one of them to answer before making a decision.</br>
</br>
From my experience as an outsider, UT is a great bang for your buck. For a Tier 2 school (not elite but Top 15), it's incredibly cheap. Resources here are similar to those at my alma mater, the University of Michigan - Ann Arbor. Career fairs attract all the top players such as Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and Apple. I've seen quite a few startups hiring here as well.</br>
</br>
In terms of rankings, UT's CS graduate program is ranked #8 via US News. Generally speaking, undergraduate programs are not explicitly ranked and generally follow the graduate rankings.</br>
</br>
Aside from their academics, UT is starting to push heavily in the startup and "Silicon Valley culture" space as well. HackTX is one of the largest hackathons with 500 people and growing, with over $10K in prizes. There are plenty of classes offered for entrepreneurship and several local incubators as well, including some affiliated with the university (e.g. ATI). UT recently hired Bob Metcalfe, an influential VC who co-invented the Ethernet, as a Director of Innovation to further advocate for startup opportunities for UT students.</br>
</br>
If you want to work on Wall Street though, you'd be better off attending a lower ranked East Coast university such as Harvard :)</br>
Answer:</br>
I'll defer to Elynn Lee's answer for the inside view.</br>
</br>
Just one addition: UT Austin is home to the Texas Advanced Computing Center, my employer, and home to (as of this writing) the 7th fastest computer in the world, and you can get an account on it! (Wanna use 100,000 cores? Be our guest. *some restrictions may apply)</br>
</br>
And the people at TACC will gladly interact with students. For instance, teams of undergraduates coached by TACC have now twice won the Student Cluster Challenge at the (mondo important) SC conference. (https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/news...) against teams from the US and all over the world. Hurray for UT, and next year you can be part of the team!</br>
<div class="anchor-list"><a name="4_4" class="lemma-anchor para-title"></a></div><div class="para-title level-3"><h3 class="title-text"></br>Question:</br></h3></div>
What are some of the best CS courses at UT Austin?</br>
Answer:</br>
The UTCS Department has a lot of really awesome courses! Our professors and faculty are really amazing and create great classes.</br>
</br>
Some of my favorites over my nearly 10 semesters have been...</br>
Dr. Lorenzo Alvisi's Distributed Systems Course (CS371D for undergrad, CS380D for grad): If you can, please take one of Dr. Alvisi's classes before you graduate. He has this infectious, enthusiastic and passionate energy about him that creates a really amazing learning environment. Aside from having a great professor, this was probably the hardest course I took at UT. I took the undergrad course during the spring of my junior year. I struggled so hard but I learned so much. I would have done the class again as a graduate student, but we agreed that I probably should diversify my portfolio instead. This class is by no means an easy class, but it was very worth the struggling and work because I came out as a better person. And, Dr. Alvisi is so friendly and always has a smile on his face - even after I finished the class, he still always says hi and we chat every once in a while!</br>
Dr. Calvin Lin's Data Structures and Algorithms Course (CS314H): If you've read any of my answers about the Turing Scholars program, you'll know that I think Dr. Lin's CS314H class is a huge advantage for incoming Turing Scholars. This was the first programming class I took in college. I thought I was hot stuff, and I was quickly shown that I had so much more to learn here at UT. It was a humbling course where you learned among a group of students with whom you felt supported and not afraid to fail. Dr. Lin makes this course incredible because he, in himself, is an amazing teacher and educator. I was on the grading staff for this class twice and I cannot say enough about how much he cares about his students, both in regard to the class but also their well-being and their adjustment to college. I learned a lot about data structures and algorithms in this class, but I also learned about teamwork, building bigger projects, and how to be a college student. Those are all incredibly valuable lessons!</br>
Dr. Vladimir Lifschitz's Introduction to Mathematical Logic Course (CS388L, grad course): I'm in this course this semester, and it's been probably my favorite theory course to date. Personally, I don't think of myself as a particularly strong theory/logic computer science student - these were the classes I always struggled in. But, Dr. Lifschitz teaches in an incredibly patient and approachable manner. When students present their proofs to the class (another thing I'm terrified of - public speaking, especially in class!), Dr. Lifschitz critiques the proofs in a very respectful manner (he doesn't make fun of the students) and provides helpful feedback regarding the actual validity of the provided solution as well as tips regarding formatting. There are times when students do miss major points in their proofs, but these are solved by asking the student to come the next class with an updated proof or to talk with him 1:1. The class is challenging, but Dr. Lifschitz makes the material approachable and the class is a welcoming learning environment.</br>
Glenn Downing's Software Engineering and Object Oriented Programming Courses (CS373 and CS371P, respectively): While I haven't taken either of these courses, I really wish I had! I have heard SO many great things about Glenn Downing's courses from students across the department. He spoke at our senior banquet last year and it was very clear that the students absolutely love him and his class.</br>
</br>
There are tons of other cool classes and professors in the UTCS Department, but these would probably be my top picks! I'm looking forward to hearing other great stories about classes in our department!</br>
Answer:</br>
In addition to the answers in this page, I think that another course worth mentioning here is the Scalable Machine Learning course offered by Dr. Inderjit Dhillon (Scalable Machine Learning) </br>
</br>
Being a perfect blend of Machine Learning and Distributed Computing, a lot of students who took this course found it useful, state of the art and relevant to contemporary issues in Computer Science.</br>
Answer:</br>
I haven't taken Dr. Lorenzo Alvisi's Distributed Systems but I've heard it is one of the best upper division classes offered at UT CS, and I'm planning to take it at some point. It is definitely not an easy class, probably one of the hardest, but also one of the most worth while. As a CS student I like to position myself to learn things that is in the immediate future for the CS industry. I chose to intern in Cloud services at Microsoft for that reason. The Distributed systems is a huge topic in CS that isn't really in the spotlight but it's vital to a lot of services and only becoming more so in how we process information. Also, professor Alvisi is awesome. Just talking to him you'll see his passion for what he teaches.</br>
</br>
Currently I'm taking Glenn Downing's Object Oriented Programming Class and although I don't enjoy it too much because I feel like its more of a C++ class rather than an OOP class, Professor Downing spends a lot of time and energy in teaching students how to prepare for real world contributions in CS and deal with interview questions. I'd say if you want to get good at CS interviews take his OOP class (CS 371P). Professor Glenn is one of the most entertaining professors too with a good sense of humor. He often highlights the beauty of doing things in a elegant and efficient way which I really appreciate because I'm a huge stickler on writing clean and beautiful code. </br>
</br>
I'd have to say that my favorite CS classes have always been the one's with professor Ahmed Gheith who usually teaches 429, 429H, 439H, or 350C (usually only teaches two classes of a semester since he also works for IBM). Prof Gheith is a super funny professor, and definitely engaging. Some people don't like his teaching style because he often spends a lot of time diving deeper into potentially "unnecessary" information, but if you have a passion of learning in CS in general you will love Gheith. I'm biased but hands down favorite professor along side Professor Mike Scott (I'd give info on Mike Scott but I don't really know what else he teaches besides 312 and iOS which he tells people not to take because it's pointless). </br>
</br>
Hope this helps :)</br>
Answer:</br>
Distributed Systems (CS380D Home Page), held by prof. Lorenzo Alvisi . The subject is amazingly difficult, but his knowledge of it is so deep, that he manages to present it in a very engaging (I daresay fun) way. He is so passioned about what he teaches as to become contagious. I'd say that a good part of this comes from prof. Alvisi being an amazing person, whose understanding of science (from physics to maths to computer science) seems unfathomable.</br>
</br>
Yes, I have followed only this one course at UT, but it's just the best I ever had in my career.</br>
Answer:</br>
I would have to say it would have to be a Downing course (course offered by Professor Downing; https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/...). My personal favorite would have to be his Software Engineering course because of all the real-world tool that you learn how to use. </br>
</br>
  When I took the course about 2 years ago I recall picking up version control (Git), Python, using the Google App Engine, database models, and some front-end experience using things such as bootstrap. Back then the course consisted of a couple of projects for the first half followed by a half semester project that was broken up which had a team construct a site that would import data via XML or some other import method and dynamically generate web pages on your site. I believe the course still follows a similar structure but I would look through the syllabus on his site provided above. </br>
</br>
  Another great thing about Professor Downing's course is that unlike most courses at UT his courses are usually very interactive; by interactive I mean that every other minute Downing will call out a student from his roster to answer questions about his lecture.</br>
</br>
  Professor Downing really does care about his students and knows exactly what is necessary for students to be successful Software Engineers once they leave college and start working in the industry. </br>
</br>
tl;dr... Software Engineering with Glenn Downing, learn how to use tools that you'll use in the real world. 10/10 would recommend.</br>

What is the minimum GRE score needed for an MS in CS from University of Texas, Austin?</br>
Answer:</br>
UT Austin is a great school. There is no such minimum score to get in( as far as I know). I have seen students with 310 getting in. To maximize your chances, make sure  you have a very good score. Also, your entire profile, i.e. your SOPs, LORs, GPA all play an important role. Try and improve your entire profile by doing some research, publishing papers etc. All the best!</br>
<div class="anchor-list"><a name="4_6" class="lemma-anchor para-title"></a></div><div class="para-title level-3"><h3 class="title-text"></br>Question:</br></h3></div>
Which university would you choose if you got accepted as a CS PhD student in the University of Chicago, University of Wisconsin and University of Texas, Austin? Why?</br>
Currently you are doing research with one of the Professor and some PhD students from the University of Chicago.</br>
Answer:</br>
Funding should be a primary issue, but I'll raise another important one: you should not be choosing a school, you should be choosing an area and an advisor and go to his/her school.  Your advisor and your research area will determine much of your initial career trajectory and what doors are open for you.</br>
</br>
CS PhD candidates I knew at those schools entered knowing exactly who they were working for and what kind of projects they would be doing.  At the very least, you should be interested in a handful of topics at most.  If you're of the attitude that anything will do, I question whether you should be doing a PhD.  If you're not sure yet, that's a legitimate situation, but you should be working to narrow your choices.  Leaving that choice until you get to the school is a really bad idea.  I say that because that's what I did, and it was incredible luck that it worked out for me.  It generally doesn't.</br>
</br>
As for the other answers about jobs and networking, CS PhD job opportunities rarely work the way they do for lower degree holders.</br>
If you are going to academia, you will not be sticking around.  Between academic inbreeding prevention and thin availability, you will likely go somewhere you never considered, assuming you get anything at all.</br>
Most PhDs keep working in their research area, and you will go wherever those jobs are.  You will have already networked with others via conferences and probably know people in Silicon Valley far better than people down the hall.  I speak from experience.</br>

It sound like you are not a graduate student, so I will answer as if you were an undergraduate. A Master's degree student is different because your choice depends who your thesis advisor is. Choosing the thesis advisor determines the school.</br>
</br>
My criteria for choosing a Doctoral Program depends on funding and how far you are with your . There are three huddles for a doctorate: being admitted with funding, passing the qualifying exams, and choosing a thesis advisor. Funding is your first consideration. If you are not accepted into a doctoral program with funding, then that department really does not want you, no matter the ranking. You go with people who want you.</br>
</br>
First, I assume that you are accepted to these Doctoral Programs with Funding, either as a TA or an RA, preferably an RA especially if you are post Master's.</br>
</br>
I cannot tell from you question if you are currently have funding at the University of Chicago. If you are a graduate student with funding, have you passed your qualifying exams? If you are Doctoral Candidate, is the professor you are currently working with your thesis advisor? If the answer is no to any one of these questions, then it makes sense to change schools. What is the determining factor is funding and how long are you in your current program.</br>
</br>
Based on ranking based on research, UT Austin is the highest ranked school and would be your best choice, if you have funding. Next would be University of Wisconsin, again if you have funding. And finally University of Chicago if you have funding.</br>
</br>
If you don't have funding, then you need to talk to your department chairperson and your current professor that you are working with at the University of Chicago to see there is research money that will somehow  support you. Without funding, you need to reconsider your next step. Such as getting a job and working on a part-time Master's so you can position yourself to get into a doctoral program with funding.</br>
</br>
What is important in a doctoral program is to have access to potential thesis advisors in a different relationship than being a student in their classes. This  access comes with funding.</br>
Answer:</br>
UT Austin in a heartbeat. They are embedded in an emerging tech hub so that means you are within close enough proximity to network (for future employment, assuming your plans are to enter industry). Also, if it turns out you like the area, the cost of living is relatively inexpensive and the city has a lot to offer entertainment wise.</br>

What are the requirements to get admission for an MS in CS in the University of Texas at Austin?</br>
i dont have great profile but i do have great or a good GRE as well as toefl score</br>
GRE-334</br>
TOEFL-117</br>
i had 17 backlogs in my undergraduate(engineering computer science) studies but i cleared it and now i have 76% as an aggregate,my </br>
CGPA-8.0</br>

and also i am from private engineering college from kerala,india</br>
but i have 4 papers published in international journals</br>
and also a pretty decent programming history</br>
build over 40+ websites,15+ applications</br>
i know more than 15+ programming languages</br>
is it possible to get into texas for MS.... is there any chance..........please help me</br>
Answer:</br>
Thanks for the A2A.</br>
</br>
To be fully honest, I'm a little confused by the other answers. The MS program is not hard to get into with a decent GPA and good test scores. Your publication history is a plus. If anything, it will make up for any weakness on the GPA front.</br>
</br>
For the MS program, there typically is no financial aid as there is for the PhD program. As such, I wouldn't stress as much about having a 4.0 GPA.</br>
Answer:</br>
It does not alone depend on your projects and the number of programming languages you know. It depends on your research interests, your statement of purpose and letters of recommendations. If you are able to show the backlog history in the positive way as why you got those? How you covered those? What inspired you and all then it won't be a issue. Secondly it depends on the quality of the research papers you worked on. What are the topics the research papers project? What are the journals you published your research papers in? If you can provide that information then it would be easy to assess the quality of the papers. Finally you are aiming for one of the best universities in USA. UT Austin is in top 10. It would be difficult to get in but not impossible. With the good GRE score you have, you can give it a shot. But don't just depend on UT Austin alone. After all it is not the only deciding factor for your career. There are other good universities too.</br>
</br>
Good luck.</br>
Answer:</br>
ou have to show a concrete reason for those 17 backlogs. Repetition will obviously affect your chance of admit. You can cover this thing in your SOP.</br>
Your GRE and TOEFL scores are perfect.</br>
And your background history will be counted as an added advantage.</br>
You can try your luck. </br>

What is the evaluation procedure like at The University of Texas at Austin? How hard is it for a normal student to survive in the Master's program in CS?</br>
Answer:</br>
Engineering grad programs in general tend to be very "easy", as there's massive amounts of grade inflation. Also, as you're also expected to do research, they tend to not give you as much busywork as undergraduate classes do. As long as you work hard, you'll make easily at least a B in all your classes (if not all A's).</br>
